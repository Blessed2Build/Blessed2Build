        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p><strong>Founder: Wegene Bezaye</strong></p>
        <p>I started Blessed 2 Build because my family and I have personally experienced the devastating effects of political instability and displacement. I am originally from Ethiopia and came to the USA to study at Clark Atlanta University. Just a month after arriving, I learned that my family's home had been demolished due to the ongoing political instability. They were forced to leave the city they had lived in and relocate to a small town in the countryside. I understand the mental, physical, and emotional toll of losing everythingâ€”family, friends, and the environment we once called home. Through this organization, I aim to support others facing similar challenges and help them rebuild their lives.</p>
